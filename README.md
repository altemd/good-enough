Welcome to your new TanStack Start app! 

# Getting Started

To run this application:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

## Local inference gateway

The application exposes a deliberately small compatibility surface through one
gateway slice:

- `GET /v1/models`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `POST /v1/messages`

Requests are forwarded to `LLAMA_SERVER_URL`, which defaults to
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Only loopback llama-server URLs are accepted. Start
llama-server with one generation slot and keep it off the external network:

```bash
llama-server \
  --model /path/to/model.gguf \
  --host 127.0.0.1 \
  --port 8080 \
  --parallel 1
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` only when you need to change the loopback port.
The gateway writes one structured metadata event per request to stdout. It does
not log prompt, completion, tool-argument, credential, or raw streaming data.
Numeric metadata is extracted only from explicitly allowlisted protocol fields;
other numbers in an API response are ignored.

### TODO: protocol-compatible error normalization

The gateway currently preserves upstream error statuses, headers, and bodies.
Its locally generated errors use one temporary generic JSON shape, so they are
not yet fully compatible with both client protocols. A later checkpoint must:

- Format gateway-originated `/v1/models` and `/v1/chat/completions` errors with
  the OpenAI error envelope.
- Format gateway-originated `/v1/messages` errors with Anthropic's top-level
  `type: "error"` envelope, nested error object, `request_id`, and `request-id`
  header.
- Preserve meaningful upstream status codes. Before streaming starts, preserve
  an upstream error body only when it already conforms to the selected
  protocol; otherwise translate it using bounded parsing and a sanitized
  fallback.
- Handle errors that occur after streaming starts as protocol-specific SSE
  error events without buffering generated output.
- Never expose configuration, credentials, prompts, completions, tool
  arguments, or unrecognized upstream body fields while translating errors.

This is a known compatibility gap, not a claim that the current local error
bodies exactly reproduce the OpenAI and Anthropic APIs. It does not require an
SDK dependency unless the later checkpoint demonstrates that one is necessary.

# Building For Production

To build this application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. You can run the tests with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

### Removing Tailwind CSS

If you prefer not to use Tailwind CSS:

1. Remove the demo pages in `src/routes/demo/`
2. Replace the Tailwind import in `src/styles.css` with your own styles
3. Remove `tailwindcss()` from the plugins array in `vite.config.ts`
4. Uninstall the packages: `pnpm add @tailwindcss/vite tailwindcss --dev`

## Linting & Formatting

This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/) for linting and formatting. The following scripts are available:


```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format
pnpm check
pnpm typecheck
```


## Deploy with Nitro

This project uses Nitro as a generic server adapter, so it can run on any Node-compatible host.

```bash
pnpm build
node .output/server/index.mjs
```

The build output is a self-contained Node server. To deploy, copy the `.output/` directory to your host and run the server command above.

For host-specific presets (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, AWS Lambda, etc.) and tuning, see https://v3.nitro.build/deploy.



## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router) with file-based routing. Routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.

### Adding Links

To use SPA (Single Page Application) navigation you will need to import the `Link` component from `@tanstack/react-router`.

```tsx
import { Link } from "@tanstack/react-router";
```

Then anywhere in your JSX you can use it like so:

```tsx
<Link to="/about">About</Link>
```

This will create a link that will navigate to the `/about` route.

More information on the `Link` component can be found in the [Link documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/framework/react/api/router/linkComponent).

### Using A Layout

In the File Based Routing setup the layout is located in `src/routes/__root.tsx`. Anything you add to the root route will appear in all the routes. The route content will appear in the JSX where you render `{children}` in the `shellComponent`.

Here is an example layout that includes a header:

```tsx
import { HeadContent, Scripts, createRootRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  head: () => ({
    meta: [
      { charSet: 'utf-8' },
      { name: 'viewport', content: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1' },
      { title: 'My App' },
    ],
  }),
  shellComponent: ({ children }) => (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <HeadContent />
      </head>
      <body>
        <header>
          <nav>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
            <Link to="/about">About</Link>
          </nav>
        </header>
        {children}
        <Scripts />
      </body>
    </html>
  ),
})
```

More information on layouts can be found in the [Layouts documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/routing-concepts#layouts).

## Server Functions

TanStack Start provides server functions that allow you to write server-side code that seamlessly integrates with your client components.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/react-start'

const getServerTime = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
}).handler(async () => {
  return new Date().toISOString()
})

// Use in a component
function MyComponent() {
  const [time, setTime] = useState('')
  
  useEffect(() => {
    getServerTime().then(setTime)
  }, [])
  
  return <div>Server time: {time}</div>
}
```

## API Routes

You can create API routes by using the `server` property in your route definitions:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { json } from '@tanstack/react-start'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/api/hello')({
  server: {
    handlers: {
      GET: () => json({ message: 'Hello, World!' }),
    },
  },
})
```

## Data Fetching

There are multiple ways to fetch data in your application. You can use TanStack Query to fetch data from a server. But you can also use the `loader` functionality built into TanStack Router to load the data for a route before it's rendered.

For example:

```tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/people')({
  loader: async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://swapi.dev/api/people')
    return response.json()
  },
  component: PeopleComponent,
})

function PeopleComponent() {
  const data = Route.useLoaderData()
  return (
    <ul>
      {data.results.map((person) => (
        <li key={person.name}>{person.name}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

Loaders simplify your data fetching logic dramatically. Check out more information in the [Loader documentation](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/guide/data-loading#loader-parameters).

# Demo files

Files prefixed with `demo` can be safely deleted. They are there to provide a starting point for you to play around with the features you've installed.
